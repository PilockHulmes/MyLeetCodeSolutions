# What To Do If You Get Fired From A Software Engineering Job?

Getting fired isn’t pleasant. It’s embarrassing, and it’s not always your fault.

But talk to anyone successful whose been fired in the past, they’ll often describe the experience as “the best thing that’s ever happened” to them.

If you gave 100% effort and you still got terminated, you’re probably feeling terrible. But I’d like to try and realign your perspective.

It’s what you do next that matters.

“Living well is the best revenge”

— George Herbert

Let’s go.

## Take a deep breath
Even if you saw it coming, or didn’t like working somewhere, getting laid-off is rough. Yesterday you were earning a salary. Today you’re unemployed.

So on day one, just focus on keeping it together.

You’re likely overwhelmed with a combination of anger, grief, and blame. Your head isn’t clear.

This is not the time to bad-mouth your previous employer on social media.

The best thing you can do is go home, order food, watch TV, or take a nap if you can.

One day means nothing in the grand scheme of things. You’ll wake up tomorrow with a little more perspective.

## Review your finances
Now it’s day two.

I’d still advise you to not do too much. But it costs money to live, so you need to do something important.

Make a budget, and figure out how long your savings will last. This influences what you’ll do next.

If you have 2+ years of savings, you can take a month off to decompress. But if you have 2 weeks of savings, you’ll have to make some decisions fast.

The more funds you have, the less stressful this experience is going to be.

Take time off if you can afford it

Software developers are prone to imposter syndrome, and it’s likely hitting you pretty hard right now. Most people can’t psychologically process that in a week.

## Accept what happened
Accept that you made a poor choice choosing your last job.

Maybe you took on a role that was too senior, you weren’t familiar with the tech stack, or something happened out of your control.

While it would be nice to put some of the blame on your last company, that won’t do any good.

If your last boss was a terrible manager, it’s your job to ensure your next boss is better.

Swallow your pride and move on. This is easier said than done.

## Start looking for new work
If you need income ASAP, reach out to previous employers who you left on good terms.

Depending on the size of the company, there’s a good chance they’ll give you a job back, or allow contract work.

Never underestimate codebase knowledge. If you’ve worked somewhere before and you’re competent, you’re probably a better hire than anyone they can find in the current market.

Then reach out to recruiters and companies on Indeed.

As much as job-hopping is the norm in 2022, it’s probably best to find a company where you won’t mind staying at least a year. A year of uninterrupted work proves your competence and will allow future employers to overlook you being terminated in the past.

## Spin your work history
If you only lasted at your previous company for 3 months, you’re going to get asked about it in your next interview.

So do your best to understand why your last role didn’t work out.

Then practise explaining it succinctly. Don’t over-explain, and definitely don’t trash talk your previous company.

If you’ve crushed the technical interview, the hiring company may not care or may be willing to give you a chance regardless.

Understand that companies are desperate to hire talented developers.

## Conclusion
The mental toll from working somewhere you don’t fit in, or are always running uphill isn’t worth it.

Everyone deserves to be happy, but sometimes it takes a while to find a company that suits your personality, tech stack, or ethics.

Whatever the cause of your termination, I’ve never heard of someone who got fired from a software engineering job and couldn’t recover.

Whatever you do, don’t forget that there’s a huge demand for software developers right now.

You have a valuable skill set and that may be the most important thing.
